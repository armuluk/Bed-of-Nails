<div id="response" class="responseSection" style="display:block;">
<p>Your answer is still not correct.</p>

<p>To find 1 OR 1 you look for the cell which is in the column headed by a 1 and is also in the row beginning with a 1:</p>

<p>This is shown in the truth table below.<p>

<table class="truthtable">
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>0</th>
  <th class="selected">1</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>0</th>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th class="selected">1</th>
  <td>1</td>
  <td class="selected">1</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So 1 OR 1 = 1</p>
<button onClick="retryClicked();">Try again</button>

</div>
