# Bed-of-Nails

Revision questions, with the figures generated randomly, so each question is distinct from previous ones, though essentially the same with different numbers/answer.

There are multiple levels for each question, hints and an explanation.

The user can choose any question, at any time. Their current levels are stored so that an appropriately difficult question is asked.

Why 'bed of nails' - revision is a bit like skewering yourself on a rather blunt and very rusty nail. However if you only do a single question on a topic and then float on to another topic it is more like resting yourself on a bed of nails.
